## Academic Doceument LaTeX Template

A LaTeX template for creating academic purposes documents or more.

## Title Credentials

Only modify the `details.tex` to modify the document title and it will automatically create the title page for you. This is done to avoid sloppy errors.

## How to compile

Prefer to use `pdflatex` since I made this template in the pdflatex environment.

Follow these steps to generate pdf output:

- Check if on the correct working directory (Where the main.tex files are located).

```bash
pwd
```

- Run this pdflatex recipe pdflatex->pdflatex->pdflatex (Run 3 times).

```bash
pdflatex main.tex
```
